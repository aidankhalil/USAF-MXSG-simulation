# USAF x USF Capstone Project 2025

## Project Overview
This repository contains the final version of an AnyLogic process mapping simulation developed for the United States Air Force (USAF).  
The simulation is designed to optimize Program Manager (PM) allocation across critical processes (referred to as *teams/gates*) at Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), using data-driven insights provided by the MXSG team.
